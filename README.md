#### Short URL Detail/Edit Page

  - the total number of visits using the short URL;
  - the total number of unique visits (one visit per _visitor ID_);
  - and the history of all the visits (visitor ID and timestamp).
- _What to know about the visitor ID:_
  - The 8 character alphanumeric visitor ID is generated at the time of registration and it is stored to the user's database.
  - Each time user logs in, this unique visitor ID is stored to the cookie until sign out.
  - If the user is not logged in, the visitor ID will be generated and stored in the cookie and will remain in the browser until cookie is cleared or expires.
